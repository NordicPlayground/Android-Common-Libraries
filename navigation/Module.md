# Module navigation

Wrapper for the [AndroidX Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/navigation) component
allowing passing typed arguments between destinations.

> **Note:**
>
> This package requires Hilt, as it's using Dependency Injection to provide the 
> [Navigator][no.nordicsemi.android.common.navigation.Navigator] class.

### Deprecation

This module may get deprecated in favor of the official Navigation Compose library,
which now also supports typed destinations using Serialization.

# Package no.nordicsemi.android.common.navigation

Set of classes and Composables to simplify navigation in a Compose application.

# Package no.nordicsemi.android.common.navigation.viewmodel
