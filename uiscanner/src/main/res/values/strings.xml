        requires Location permission in order to scan for Bluetooth Low Energy devices. This
        is because Bluetooth LE beacons, for example iBeacons or Eddystone, may be used to
        determine the phone\'s and user\'s location.\n\n<b>nRF Connect Device Manager</b> will not use
		this information in any way.\n\nOn Android 12 and above, a new Bluetooth Scan permission
		could be requested with a flag that disables scanning for location, but on this system
		version no scan results are returned without location enabled.</string>
