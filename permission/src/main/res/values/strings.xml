    <string name="location_permission_info">From Android 6.0 Marshmallow until Android 11 the application
        requires Location permission in order to scan for Bluetooth Low Energy devices. This
        is because Bluetooth LE beacons, for example iBeacons or Eddystone, may be used to
        determine the phone\'s and user\'s location.\n\nThe app will not use
		this information in any way.\n\nOn Android 12 or newer a new Nearby permission
		can be requested instead, without the need for location, but this system
		version does not support that feature.</string>
